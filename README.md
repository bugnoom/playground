# INSTALL PLUGINS AND PLATFORMS
Install all the required Cordova plugins the app needs with the following command:

ionic cordova prepare

This command will actually restore all the platforms and plugins are included in the package.json file.

Note: In case you do not work on a Mac OS machine, open the package.json file and replace the iOS platform with the Android platform or leave the cordovaPlatforms array empty if you do not want to add a platform yet.
